# DesignPattern
A project on description of various Design Patterns

### Abstract Factory-
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
### Adapter-
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
### Bridge-
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
### Builder-
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
### Chain of Responsibility-
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
### Command-
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
### Composite-
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
### Decorator-
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
### Facade-
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
### Factory-
Method Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
### Flyweight-
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. Interpreter Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
### Iterator-
 Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
### Mediator-
 Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
### Memento-
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
### Observer-
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
### Prototype-
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
### Proxy-
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
### Singleton-
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
### State-
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
### Strategy-
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
### Template Method-
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
### Visitor-
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
